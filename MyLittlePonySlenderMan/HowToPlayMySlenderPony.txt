Welcome to My Slender Pony! 

This is how you play the game: 

1. Firstly, you choose a character by using the mouse to click on them. 
2. After you choose, then you start moving around with the arrowkeys or ASDW.
3. Now you move around and have to find 5 boxes. 
4. When you find a box, then you have to use the mouse bottum to collect it. 
5. When you've found all the boxes, you win. If not, you get a surprise.
